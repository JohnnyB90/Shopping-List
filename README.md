# Shopping List Form

This can be used to keep a list of items needed to get while out shopping. It will save them in the local device to reference at a later date with the ability to remove them when desired.

If there are any issues, please contact me and report them.

I cannot take full credit for this shopping list as the HTML was aquired during full stack bootcamp at UNCC
